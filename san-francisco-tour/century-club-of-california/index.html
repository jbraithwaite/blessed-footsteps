HORACE WILSON:  Ladies of the Century Club:</p><p>            It gives me great pleasure to present to you this afternoon a prophet of Persia, who takes great pleasure in speaking to the members of the Century Club.</p><p>            ‘ABDU’L-BAHA:  <em>This is a delightful gathering. It is a delightful afternoon. Such revered ladies have gathered together with the central purpose of investigating the verities of life.</em></p><p><em>            In the world of existence, there is no issue as important as that of investigating reality, for the illumination of the world in dependent upon reality. Were it not for the light of reality, the world would be dark indeed. When we glance at history, we find certain critical stages when darkness was overspread throughout the world; but when the light of reality shone again then the world became illumined once more.</em></p><p><em>            Among such periods in human history was the one preceding the appearance of His Holiness Christ, when the darkness of superstition and imagination had covered the earth and all mankind were submerged in the sea of superstition. Then the light of reality, through the instrumentality of Christ, appeared, then the horizon of the human world was flooded with light, the world of humanity advanced, the realities of things were revealed and thereby we learn that reality is light and light is reality.</em></p><p><em>            In these modern days there are difficult questions and colossal problems facing humanity, which problems can only be solved by the appearance of light, and one whereof I shall speak this afternoon is that relative to the equality of man and woman.</em></p><p><em>            The people in the world are divided into 2 classes concerning this question, some believing that man is greater and the preferable as a member of the body-politic, and, moreover, they believe that as regards creation man is possessed of certain superior virtues. This class, represented by people who believe in the superiority of man, declare that whosoever [sic] howsoever much woman may advance she can never reach the level of man, because she is not equipped creationally with the same faculties or to that extent as man is endowed therewith.</em></p><p><em>            The majority of the people are of this opinion at present, whereas another class, representing the minority still, but who may become the majority ere long and will overcome the preceding class, are of the opinion that perfect equality does exist and this minority, which is supported by reasonableness, declare that God must be just, and justice demands the equal distribution of good gifts. Were there to be any distinction, this is sheer tyranny, and the Lord is free therefrom.</em></p><p><em>            Secondly, they declare that all are human, and as regards all the faculties and powers they share them in common, that in creation there is no radical distinction of difference, and that which is not creationally present – why should we create it?</em></p><p><em>            Thirdly, they declare that in all forms of life, in all phenomena, you will observe the distinctions of gender – there are male and female elements. Were you to study the vegetable kingdom you shall find that all are either male or female, and in the animal kingdom these two are present, and in neither of these is there any distinction nor is there any fight for suffrage. Nay, rather there is perfect equality between the male and the female. In the animal kingdom, the male never asserts its authority or any doubted superiority. Nay, rather they live in the utmost of fellowship, without any quarrels regarding any imagined differences. </em></p><p><em>            In the vegetable kingdom, where conscious knowledge is minus, or absent in the animal kingdom where the faculty of reason is minus, we do not find this desire for superiority, or, rather this tyranny manifest. The males never declare that they are superior to the females.</em></p><p><em>            And now man, who is a superior form of life, who is endowed with reason, who is informed of the justice of God, who is capable of discovering the reality of things – how can he be willing to admit of such injustice?</em></p><p><em>            Although there is equality between men and women, for God has created all human, still there are those who assert this superiority.</em></p><p><em>            The world of humanity is possessed of two eyes, and the world of phenomena are possessed of two organs. Throughout you will find that these two organs are represented by the male and the female. If one eye should prove defective, undoubtedly, the defect will handicap the operation of the other, because perfect cooperation is necessary for happiness. Unless both eyes are perfectly normal, the visual process cannot be perfect and whole. Likewise, so long as man and woman have not reached the stage of perfection, the world of humanity is far behind, is hindered.</em></p><p><em>            The world of humanity is possessed of two wings.  One wing is represented by the male, the other is symbolized by the female.</em></p><p><em>            If one wing should be defective, it will hinder the flight of the bird, but when both wings are equivalent in strength, when both are capable, then the flight of the bird is made easy. </em></p><p><em>            Likewise, the world of humanity, when its two members enjoy equivalent rights, and when both enjoy their prerogatives, then this body-politic will wing its way through the atmosphere upward.</em></p><p><em>            Moreover, the great educator of man is woman, for the first educator is the mother.  The first teacher is the mother, and if the mother should be defective or deficient in her attainments, if the teacher be illiterate, how can the pupil be perfect? Therefore, the teacher must be well qualified in order that her pupil or student may be equally qualified.</em></p><p><em>            How can man, therefore, assert that his first teacher educator, his first trainer, the one who has first given him his training in the kind love of the mother – in other words, his own mother – is deficient in qualities which make a human being perfect? </em></p><p><em>            This is no other than ignorance and injustice!</em></p><p><em>            These poor mothers have to rear the children, they have to educate the child, passing their nights restless, or sleepless, and their days without composure, often laboring with care concerning the child for twenty years, until that child reaches the age of maturity, and as soon as it reaches that mature age then the child, or the youth, declares: “Mother, thou art imperfect; I am perfect. Thou art weak, whereas I am mighty. Thou art deficient mentally, whereas I am equipped intellectually. I am superior to thee. I am capable of functions whereof thou art deficient. I am nobler than thee.” </em></p><p><em>            Is this the reward of all the labors and tender care given the child? What an ignorance is this! What manifest oppression and wrong that a man should imagine his dear mother to be thus imperfect, to imagine his mother to be incapable after twenty years of care and service! How arduous have been her services to the child! </em></p><p><em>            Woman educates man, and not the reverse. Therefore, the right of woman is truly great.</em></p><p><em>            On the contrary, man does not endure a great deal of hardship.  He does not have his sleep at night disturbed, nor his attention during the day perturbed, for the children do not seem to bother the father. They are quite carefree. It is only when the child is mature, and is not of all the troubles, that the father comes to claim him, when, as a matter of fact, it is the duty of the father, of man, to be the most grateful creature, addressing womankind, saying, </em></p><p><em>            “O ye women! O ye mothers! How kind have ye been! How tender have ye been unto us! How well have you suffered us to attain to our present stage of maturity! Verily, we can never offer ye thanks sufficiently.”</em></p><p><em>            Nay, on the contrary, when they demand their right, they do not even give them, and they say, “In brain efficiency and in your susceptibilities, and in serenity and composure, are ye deficient and inferior.”</em></p><p><em>            Why? What is the reason therefore?</em></p><p><em>            The answer is: “The weight of your brain is anatomically proved to be less somewhat,” and this seems to be the only practical and tangible reason offered, whereas this is not in accordance with facts even, because often large brains, or great heads, having been dissected, have been found to be wanting, when reference is made to former history of brain efficiency, and how often very small heads, and rather small brains, have proved to be the most intelligent, and if the avoirdupois of the brain and that of the size of the skull are indicative of brain efficiency, then, verily, I say unto thee that the donkey is the brainiest, because evidently the head of the donkey is far larger than the others, and the skull of man can never reach the size of that of the donkey.</em></p><p><em>            Hence, brain power is not dependent upon the size of the skull nor upon its contents. Nay, it is rather to the character of its convolutions.</em></p><p><em>            Brilliancy is not dependent upon the incandescent lamp – the bowl itself. Nay, rather it is upon the character of the electric energy.</em></p><p><em>            The power of mind, and that of observation, are not dependent upon any such reasons. It is rather dependent upon that faculty which operates through the instrument.</em></p><p><em>            But this has to be admitted: that womankind has not received the same education as man. The opportunities of education in the past have not been equivalent. But if the means for the education of the fair sex be perfected, without doubt, they will prove the same attainments, and undoubtedly will they attain to that level when they can be peers of men.</em></p><p><em>            One thing remains to be said in the way of objections advanced.</em></p><p><em>            They say that woman has proved her deficiency on certain occasions and were you to ask as to the character of that objection they will immediately respond thus, saying, “Woman is not a courageous as man; woman has not wielded the sword as man; she has not built any cannons, nor has she been a good user of the gun, and on the battle-field she has never exhibited any part of valor.”</em></p><p><em>            But this is ferocity and no deficiency. If this be valor or courage, then the wolf is verily the most superior of all the animals, because the wolf in that capacity is very perfect indeed, is very ferocious. Hence, the wolf must be the noblest of creatures.</em></p><p><em>            Valor or courage are not dependent upon the exhibition of ferocity, upon the shedding of blood. Nay, rather valor is dependent upon reasonableness, upon perception, upon attainment, upon knowledge and perfection. It is not dependent upon ferocity or the shedding of blood. If woman, therefore, is not ferocious, this is not a deficiency.  </em></p><p><em>            Furthermore, when we regard history, we find that certain women have appeared who have surpassed men even in points of valor or courage.</em></p><p><em>            Among the famous characters of history is Queen Zenobia.</em></p><p><em>            As you well know Queen Zenobia was a Roman woman, and in Syria did she establish a sovereignty. She conquered Egypt. Then the Roman Empire, with all power, endeavored to withstand her greatness. Then sent a very large army to withstand her march. When the Roman army entered the battle-field it witnessed Zenobia with a crown upon her head, with her hair scattered and with a gilded uniform as a general of her army, and on that occasion she scattered and battered the army of the Romans to that extent that they seemed to run away, even as far as Rome. They went back.</em></p><p><em>            This was, indeed, an expression of valor on her part.</em></p><p><em>            They decided, at last, to have the Roman Emperor go himself, and he, with all his army, went, and he could not, even with his army, defeat Zenobia.</em></p><p><em>            Eventually, Queen Zenobia was besieged in a certain castle in that region called Palmyra, and she was there for two years virtually a prisoner. After two years, owing to starvation, she had to surrender. But because of her former courage and valor and greatness, the Emperor summoned her to Rome. The day of her arrival at Rome, she effected her entry into the capital in a certain way. She had the following arrangement:</em></p><p><em>            The elephants were conducted ahead of her, after the array of elephants the lions, and after the lions the tigers, and then the bears, then the wolves, then the monkeys, and this was to humiliate her, and last of all the animals was Zenobia placed to enter the city, with a crown upon her head, and her uniform, and with bare feet, and with chains around her neck. But the whole idea was to show how courageous Zenobia was, and that courage was supposed to be symbolized or represented by the animals which had preceded her, and in point of courage compared to the lions and the tigers and so on, and as regards cunningness and stratagem, etc., as the wolves and monkeys and so on. And, above all, he wanted to prove that he was the greatest of all, that he had taken such a women, with power so great formerly, and now arrested as a prisoner of his.</em></p><p><em>            Zenobia offered a speech, saying: “Verily, this Emperor – the Roman Emperor – rules virtually half of the world, is the king of all Europe then and most parts of Asiatic countries, whereas I am only the Queen of Syria, and he had to labor for two years in order to besiege me. Were I in his stead, many of the kings and crowned heads would I have defeated. I had only one country, and for three years did I have this fight, but what would I do if I had a larger country?”</em></p><p><em>            Among the women was Catherine – the Russian Catherine – and it is historically a fact that were it not for Catherine the Russian Empire would have been entirely effaced and Peter the Great would have been defeated. This woman, through her great sagacity and valor, protected her realm and was the cause of its advancements. As history bears testimony in this fact, she was the great Russian reformer.</em></p><p><em>            Among the women was Cleopatra, who, through her sagacity and cunningness and cleverness, discomfited the Roman Empire.</em></p><p><em>            And among them is a woman most remarkable for her work among the Israelites, a woman who really restored the glory of Israel. For forty years the children of Israel were endeavoring to conquer the Holy Land, but they failed. At last, through the great sagacity of one woman, they were capable of so doing, and this is sacred history.</em></p><p><em>            Among the renowned women of the world was Mary the Magdalene. After the crucifixion of His Holiness Christ, the disciples of Christ were greatly agitated. Even Peter denied His Holiness Christ, but Mary the Magdalene, this most spiritual and virtuous woman, confirmed all the disciples, and caused them to arise to serve Christ, and she served Christ in such a fashion as to render her name famous throughout the world, such was her worthy service to the Christian cause and such was the great firmness she exhibited!</em></p><p><em>            And amongst the women there have been certain women and are certain Bahá’í women in Persia who are most courageous, most eloquent, most scholarly, well-informed, long-suffering.</em></p><p><em>            Noteworthy amongst them was Qurrat’l-‘Ayn [“Solace of the Eyes”, the Persian poetess Táhirih].  She was a woman of the ecclesiastical class, and she withstood the Shah of Persia, she withstood the oppression of the ulamas, the learned men of Persia. She, single and alone, stood for the cause of woman in Persia, and to the last breath she was eloquent with the greatest power and courage. At last she was executed. She did not shake at all. The utmost of courage and valor was she.</em></p><p><em>            And there are a number now of her type, one known as [Bahíyyih], or the “Greatest Holy Leaf.”  There are a number who are most courageous – mighty women amongst men.</em></p><p><em>            All this evidence proves that woman is not deficient when opportunity is presented to her. They are indeed equivalent to men, but they have not had the educational opportunities which men have enjoyed. Therefore, in certain instances, they have not exhibited that power. But were they to be educated as men, they will prove most capable, and their susceptibilities, which are keen, will reveal themselves. Their perceptions are acute indeed, their intelligence is indeed great, and all their mental faculties are excessive, and most especially under difficulties and ordeals are they the most patient and long-suffering. </em></p><p><em>            For example, when a man dies, leaving five children, the poor mother has to take care of these five children. She patiently does it, educating them, rearing them, giving them that which no other creature can give, the affection which is peculiar to her kind. But if a mother passes away, leaving five children, it is exceedingly rare for a father to perform these functions. They will be scattered. They will be really orphans. But the mother does for them and does give them that which the other can not, causing them to reach maturity.</em></p><p><em>            Therefore, men must be exceedingly grateful to womankind, who have endured so much hardship and who thus render worthy service to humanity. They must be very grateful to them, and not that they should say, ‘You are still inferior to us, and you are deficient, whereas we are efficient.’ This is an oppression which is soon to pass away.</em></p><p>MRS. WILSON: I suggest that we give a standing vote of thanks for this illuminating and encouraging address to us today.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>According to The Diary of Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání Chronicling `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá&#x27;s Journey to America<em>,</em> pp. 331-332, Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání summarized the afternoon meeting in this way:</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>“This afternoon the Master gave an address at the Century Club in San Francisco on the rights and education of women before an audience of women and their husbands. They were captivated and so overcome with joy that they begged to be introduced to Him and to attain His presence. This was a gathering of wealthy people and there was an abundance of food and refreshments. The Master had some tea and sweets and then left. When He was outside the building, crowds of people surrounded Him, demonstrating their joy, love and respect.</p><p> </p><p>After the meeting, the Master remarked:</p><p><em>I speak according to the demands of the time and the capacity of my listeners. `The father makes gurgling sounds for the newborn infant, although his wisdom be capable of measuring the universe”</em>[From the Sufi poet Rúmí.] </p><pre><code>{
