On the other hand many cities on the Pacific Coast were imploring Him by telegraph to visit them. So He was perplexed and said: &quot;Let us consult together. What shall I do? Which call shall I heed? Let us consult together. Point out the way to me.&quot; </p><p>In the afternoon He returned to the same theme when walking through Sutro Heights, the beautiful gardens on the cliffs by the ocean, belonging to the estate of an early settler.

Your cities should associate one with another.  For instance, they should come from Denver and Chicago and you should pay them visits. </p><p>Upon seeing a steamer that was once owned by Mr. Goodall passing in through the Gold Gate, Abdu’l-Bahá said: “Captain Goodall never thought that his daughter was to be an Admiral.” </p><p><strong>According to Ella Goodall Cooper Collection, M-7, Box 21, National Bahá’í Archives, United States.  </strong></p><p> “In the short house talk He gave in the late afternoon he again dwelt on the beauty of the Sutro Gardens and the capacity of San Francisco to achieve great spiritual progress.”</p><p><strong>We will conclude our tour by sharing one of the two Tablets to Bahá’ís living in the Western States written by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá a little over 4 years after His journey to California.</strong> </p><p>Revealed on February 15, 1917, in Bahá’u’lláh’s room at the house of Abbúd in ‘Akká, and addressed to the Bahá’ís of the eleven Western States of the United States: New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California, Wyoming, Utah, Montana, Idaho, Oregon and Washington.</p><p><em>He is God!

Verily, Thou art the helper of the weak and the defender of the little ones, and verily Thou art the Powerful, the Mighty and the Unconstrained.","spans":[{"start":0,"end":456,"type":"em"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"*****************","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"This concludes this tour created with the hope of familiarizing and inspiring current and future generations with some of the accounts of the conversations and talks of ‘Abdul-Bahá during His visit to San Francisco.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"With the exception of the Tablet to the Western States, each of the accounts, whether penned by newspaper reporters or individual witnesses, are to be considered as merely personal impressions and understandings of the actions and words uttered by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Additional locations in San Francisco and other California locations visited by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, including brief stories, can be found here:","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"https://www.sfbahai.org/abdul-baha-visited-california-october-1912/ ","spans":[{"start":0,"end":67,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://www.sfbahai.org/abdul-baha-visited-california-october-1912/"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"A summary of the “Life of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá” can be found here: https://www.bahai.org/abdul-baha/life-abdul-baha ","spans":[{"start":59,"end":107,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://www.bahai.org/abdul-baha/life-abdul-baha"}}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"You are welcome to share any comments about the tour with Charleen Maghzi-Ader at cmaghzi@gmail.com.","spans":[]}]}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/san-francisco-tour/[uid]","query":{"uid":"sutro-heights-park"},"buildId":"ApqqmYjxqs2wHYbElRhGS","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
