It was shortly before two o’clock in the morning, the train having been several hours late. Dr. Frederick W. D&#x27; Evelyn, chairman of the San Francisco Bahá’í Assembly, had waited at the Ferry Building to meet and escort them to the residence at 1815 California Street which had been secured by Mrs. Helen S. Goodall for their San Francisco sojourn.</p></blockquote><p>Dr.  D’Evelyn has left this account of the arrival of &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá to San Francisco:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>SAN FRANCISCO, October 3, 1912.</p><p>The trans-continental passengers to San Francisco leave their train at Oakland, and are ferried across the Bay to their journey&#x27;s end. Arriving there, they disembark and follow the wharf to a long corridor, terminating on the &quot;Main Street,&quot; here their friends are permitted to meet them.</p><p>It was October 2nd, 1912, a day of great expectancy in San Francisco. The furnished home prepared for &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was garnished, swept and beflowered.  All arrangements were complete. Slowly the hours seemed to pass. Eventide came, and with it, disconcerting reports of delay. Telegrams confirmed that the reports, while telegrams to railway headquarters brought the discomforting news that schedule time had been abandoned, and no time of arrival was hazarded. Close on mid-night a telegram from &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá instructed friends not to await His arrival, ‘send only one friend to depot.’ Without in leastwise anticipating such orders, we were instructed to comply with &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá’s request.</p><p>Securing two taxis we left for the Ferry. Arriving there we ascertained the sections may possibly arrive about 1.30 a.m. The night deepened, the Ferry was deserted. The lights of the city waned to a minimum. The ever dimly lighted corridor became still darker and still more gloomy and lonely. But we were awaiting the Master.  At 1.40 a.m. the siren announced the incoming of a belated ferry-boat. Some minutes later the slide at the end of the corridor was upraised. A few, very few emerged. They reached the street, still no evidence of the Master. What, if he was not there? The half-lowered slide seemed a sort of possibly confirmatory evidence. By this time, a night patrol man, we of the taxi party and a red-capped porter constituted the entire population of the corridor. The red-cap we assumed had come over the Bay, so addressing him we enquired had all the passengers of both sections come over? His reply was negative. Still hoping, we ventured to enquire - were there any unusual looking people on board? Yes, he replied, there is a very old gentleman with strange dress and several other strangers with Him. This was reassuring. Once again we hoped and centered our gaze upon the far end of the corridor. Some minutes later &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá appeared, walking slowly, calmly, majestically, followed by his secretaries. Forgetful of boundary lines, uncovering, we advanced to meet him. He drew near more rapidly and with outstretched arms he embraced us, uttering a salutation followed by the English words-&quot;Very good; very good.&quot;  &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá was in San Francisco.</p><p>Leading the way to the side-walk where the taxis awaited us, one was naturally desirous after seating &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, to attend to the welfare of his staff. But it was not to be, for saying something to his staff, he, through an interpreter, desired that we should seat ourselves beside him. The strange, great, new thing awed one into silence. But &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, with a perceptible note of pleasure, a victorious gladsomeness in his voice as if a long-hoped for moment had been attained - said, &quot;Speak to me.&quot; But how could one speak, what would one say-was it not the birthing of a moment-from which henceforth even time must find its dating, and eternity its reckoning?</p><p>Ere long we reached the home, made ready by true, loving and expectant friends.  Rare indeed was the reverential welcome extended to &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá. Orient and Occident had met. Supper was served, prepared by Persian friends then resident in San Francisco.  Truly a never to be forgotten communion.  The guest, the words of wisdom, the mentionings of the past, the herald-dawn of a wondrous present.</p><p>That night we slept under the master’s roof, our room-mate being Fugeta of Japan, now of Haifa. Time has even now confirmed its memory as a reality, while history registers it an epoch significant and momentous. &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá reached San Francisco, the west-the sun had set, the lamps were lightless, the people slumbered and slept. The Center of the Covenant, Bearer of the Message, came and uttered the call of the Kingdom of God. ‘Be confident, have no doubt about it, this banner of Bahá’u’lláh will be unfurled waving towards all religions. The anthem of the Oneness of the world of humanity will confer a new life upon all the children of men.’</p><p>Thirteen years later, the memory echoes this benediction as a greeting to the loved ones far away in the Isles of the Southern Seas. Truly, this is a glad-tiding.  Alláh’u’Abhá.</p></blockquote><p> Marion Yazdi recalled “He was met at the Ferry Building by Dr. Frederick D’Evelyn, Helen Goodall, Ella Goodall Cooper and Mr. and Mrs. W.C. Ralston.”</p><p>Alas, “‘Abdu’l-Bahá reached San Francisco.  A house at 1815 California Street had been rented for Him.”</p><p>Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání, chronicling `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá&#x27;s journey to America, further describes His arrival to San Francisco as follows: “Tonight the train carrying the beloved Master reached the shores of the Pacific Ocean. Dr. [Frederick] D&#x27;Evelyn, a devoted Bahá&#x27;í, came running as soon as he saw the Master and prostrated himself at His feet. On the way to the city Dr. D&#x27;Evelyn described for about 15 minutes the yearning of the friends and how they longed to see the Center of the Covenant. When we reached the house especially prepared for `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá the waiting friends came out to welcome Him.  Mr. and Mrs. Ralston, Mrs. Goodall, Mrs. Cooper and the other friends were ecstatically happy to have the honor and bounty of being in His presence and to have supper with Him.”</p><p></p><h3 class="" id="b3ZlcnZpZX">Overview of San Francisco daily routine</h3><p>Ella Cooper summarized ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s typical days in San Francisco</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>&#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was immediately in demand. In fact, His entire sojourn was divided between pre-arranged public meetings and interviews granted the hundreds of callers who had read in the newspapers of his arrival with dozens of impromptu gatherings for the Bahá’í friends, interspersed between. Notwithstanding his time was so fully occupied, he made a point of motoring nearly every day in Golden Gate Park, where he could enjoy the trees and flowers and walk around the numerous lakes watching the birds. He also walked frequently in the neighborhood parks (plazas), sometimes with his secretaries, but often alone. October is such a beautiful month in San Francisco and &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was very appreciative of the Indian summer weather.</p></blockquote><h3 class="" id="cmVjZWl2ZW">Received callers to pay their respects and to invite him to speak </h3><p>Ella Cooper shared that “&#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá was engaged almost that entire first day in receiving reporters from the cosmopolitan papers and the callers who came to pay their respects and to invite him to speak at their respective churches, clubs or other organizations.”</p><h2 class="" id="YW4gYWNjb3">An account of the first hours after &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá’s arrival </h2><p>Ramona Brown describes the first meeting of the friends with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá: </p><p>“It was October 3, 1912, when &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá arrived in San Francisco.  He had rented a lovely home at 1815 California Street, which had been selected for Him and His entourage by Helen and Ella.  Shortly after He arrived there, friends started calling upon the Master.  When Helen and Ella entered, He said to them:</p><p></p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>I am tired.  Therefore, I do not rise.  Welcome!  Last night I thought of your efforts, and I supplicated God in your behalf.  May Bahá’u&#x27;lláh reward you amply for indeed you have toiled well.’  As other friends arrived, &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá said to them: ‘How are you? Welcome, very welcome!  I am greatly rejoiced at meeting you all.  Praise be to God you came now.</p><p>Meetings are various in kind.  One meeting is like the meeting of people, an ordinary meeting, which is so easily forgotten.  Howsoever kind they may be to each other they will forget it.  For example, a brother meeting another brother, the father meeting his son, sisters meeting, the mother meeting a daughter, or the daughter the mother, when separation takes place in the course of time gradually that relation will be forgotten.  Such a meeting is without result; eventually it sinks into forgetfulness.</p><p>Another meeting is similar to the meeting of the sun with the mirror.  The rays of the sun shine upon the mirror.  Again, there may be a meeting like the coming together of combustible wood with fire, or the mingling of oil with fire.  As soon as contact is effected, combustion takes place.  Ah, such a meeting is good!</p><p>Again, there is a meeting which is like unto the contact of the gentle zephyrs with the tree, which exhilarates the trees, which bestows freshness and verdure; such a meeting is verily a meeting resulting in fruits and flowers.</p><p>I hope that our meeting will be of this last type.  May it be like unto the meeting of the gentle zephyrs with the trees.  I will supplicate that you will be fully aided in this.</p><p>A number of persons coming from the Orient to the Occident for this purpose: this is very wonderful.  You cannot find a record of it in any history of any nation.  At the utmost, a person, or a number of persons, may go across the continent for sightseeing, for trade or commerce, but simply to travel for the meeting of the friends and for the sake of spiritual communion, this is very rare.</p><p>This is brought about through the favors of the Blessed Perfection.  This is through the bounty of Baha’u’llah.  We witness how He has brought about this spiritual connection among the hearts and how He has attracted these hearts together.</p><p>This is one of the evidences of Bahá’u&#x27;lláh.  No other except Bahá’u&#x27;lláh could bring about such a condition.  No one could achieve such a colossal work, that a Persian personage and a Japanese gentleman should associate together in the utmost love here in San Francisco.  This is the potency of Bahá’u&#x27;lláh.</p><p>In brief, you are very, very welcome, most welcome!  You have traveled yourselves to come so far.  For this I am made very happy.</p><p>I will meet you again tonight.  I did not sleep last night on the train.  I arrived this morning and am a little fatigued.  I will meet you again soon.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="bWVldGluZy">Meeting with friends in the afternoon</h2><p>Ramona Brown describes her family’s meeting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>On &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá’s first day in San Francisco my mother, father, brother, and I crossed the bay on a ferryboat late in the afternoon to pay our respects to Him.  When we arrived at His home, we were welcomed by friends and ushered to His room. For a moment we stood at the open door.  I knew as I stood there that I expected to see an angel from Heaven.  And I did!  I saw the Master!  He came toward us, a wonderful smile on His saintly face, extending His outstretched arms to us and saying in Persian, “<em>Welcome! Welcome!”</em></p><p>That exhilarating, magic moment of seeing &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá for the first time was like seeing the sun burst forth through the soft, rosy glow of dawn.  It brought the nearness of God, and my heart was filled with praise and gratitude for the bounty of being with Him.  I knew that His visit to California was a very special gift from God.  As we entered the presence of the Master, He appeared to be enveloped in a beautiful, ethereal, luminous light.  The room seemed flooded with sunshine.  Flowers were everywhere, and their fragrance filled the air.  As &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá stood there in His native dress, an ‘abá and turban, He was surrounded by a golden glow.  My heart felt as though it would burst with joy and happiness to be at last in the presence of the beloved Master, to see Him with my own eyes and hear His beautiful voice as He spoke to my precious family.</p><p>The Master took my mother’s hands and said, ‘W<em>elcome, Mrs. Allen, welcome, very welcome!  You have a very united family, a very united family, and you will all be united through all the worlds of God.</em>’  His words to my mother made us very happy.  Then in His warm, gentle hands He took the hand of each one of us and welcomed us.  When I gave &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá some yellow roses I had gathered from our garden, He was very pleased.  He smiled as He thanked me and seemed happy with my small gift, for He knew that my love went with it.  As He looked into my eyes, His gentle, smiling eyes touched my soul; they seemed to tell me that He knew what was in my heart and everything about me.  I felt as though I were in another world.  At that moment I silently gave my heart and dedicated my life to Him.</p><p>He invited us to be seated, and continued speaking telling us how happy He was to meet the California believers and that He hoped His Father’s Message would reach the hearts of the people.  He conversed with us as though we were old friends, and to each of us He spoke some special words.  Then &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá arose for His chair and, stepping lightly, but like a king, served us with His own hands, in small crystal glasses, the most delicious tea I had ever tasted.  It was light amber-colored Persian tea which He had brought with Him.  To this day I can remember its fragrance and taste its sweetness.</p><p>The happiness of that first meeting has remained with me all of my life.  We knew that we were blessed and privileged to be in the presence of &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá.  We were full of deep joy as we basked in His love.  Soon it was time to take our leave, for other people were waiting to greet Him.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="dmlzaXQgYn">Visit by David Starr Jordan, Stanford University President</h2><p>Although Ella Cooper’s comprehensive list of interviews and meetings does not specifically mention that David Starr Jordan, the president of Stanford University, met with &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá in San Francisco on October 3, Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání records that “Among some of the prominent people visiting `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá was the president of Stanford University at Palo Alto. He was so attracted to the teachings that he begged the Master to come to his university and speak. Some newspaper reporters also visited the Master and were permitted to record His words about the teachings and history of the Cause. They too were showered with His special bestowals.”</p><p>As early as April 11, 1912, plans were already being made for &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá to speak at Stanford as reported in the <em>Oakland California Tribune:</em></p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>&#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá Abbás will visit all of the principal cities of the country, making addresses not only before the Bahá’í assemblies, but before audiences of all cults and all denominations as well as many college and university settlements and educational societies. He will speak before the Lake Mohonk conference on &quot;International Arbitration&quot; and in California he will address an audience at Leland Stanford University.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="bmV3c3BhcG">Newspaper announces Stanford University talk within two weeks</h2><p>The <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> published an article the day of His arrival on October 3 reporting that &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá would be speaking at an assembly at Stanford “within two weeks.”  </p><p>On the next day, the<em> Chronicle</em> reported that “&#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá has been invited to deliver a talk at Stanford University by Dr. David Starr Jordan, which he has accepted. Speaking of this yesterday, he said: </p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p><em>The duty of educated men especially university presidents of the Nation is this: &quot;To teach in the universities and schools ideas concerning universal peace, so that the student may be so molded that in after years he may help carry to fruition the most useful and human issue of mankind</em>.&quot;</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="Y29udmVyc2">Conversation about the Blessed Beauty during an automobile visit to Golden Gate Park</h2><p>‘In the afternoon, after seeing many visitors and answering questions from some reporters, at the invitation of Mrs. Goodall the Master went to see the beautiful and tranquil Golden Gate Park located outside of the city.  In the automobile on the way to the park the Master spoke about the grandeur of the Revelation of the Blessed Beauty:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p><em>No one was a denier of His virtues. All the wise men of the East considered Him the greatest person in the world. But they said, `Alas, that He has claimed divinity for Himself.&#x27; Many of the people of the East said and wrote about me, too, `all agree that he excels in knowledge, learning, speech and explanation, but, alas! he is the propagator of a new law&#x27;. They expected us to be servants and propagators of their old dogmas and customs, not knowing that we are obliged to serve humanity and spread universal love and harmony.</em></p><p><em>If all others have a few daughters and sons, I have thousands of spiritual offspring and heavenly children like you.</em></p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="Z2F2ZSBhIH">Gave a short address at a public meeting on the subject of spiritual life</h2><p>Sometime during the day “The Master gave a short address at a public meeting on the subject of spiritual life:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p><em>We aspire to find true human beings in this world. Man becomes human only through spiritual life, and the foundation of such a life is made up of heavenly perfections, divine attributes, service to humanity, eagerness to receive eternal bounties, praiseworthy morals, unity, love of God, wisdom and knowledge of God. If the aim were this physical life only, then this creation would be in vain and men would not have more honor or be nobler than other creatures. The greatest of sensual pleasures, beauty of appearance and freedom are found among the animals. Birds excel all in sensual pleasures, for they build nests on the loftiest branches and breathe the purest air. All seeds and fruit are their property. Limpid streams, charming plains, beautiful fields, verdant hills, green valleys, exquisite gardens and lovely flowers are all for their pleasure and happiness. They have no grief, regrets, aspirations, ambitions, quarrels, contentions, wars or massacres. If the purpose of existence is sensual life and pleasures, then animal and man are equal. Happiness and pleasure are rather the possession of the bird and not those of distressed and sorrowful men. </em></p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="Zm9ybWFsIH">Formal reception in the afternoon</h2><p>Ella Cooper informs us that “…late in the afternoon, He attended a formal reception tendered in His honor by the Bahá’ís of the Bay area at 1537 Jackson Street, the Oakland home of Mrs. Goodall.”</p><p>According to Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání “There was a gathering in the afternoon at the home of Mrs. Goodall and Mrs. Cooper in Oakland. The friends of Oakland and San Francisco rejoiced at meeting Him and the seekers were grateful and appreciative of His guidance. A large crowd filled the spacious house. Both before and after the meeting, those who had not had the honor of meeting `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá came in groups to the second floor and were honored to receive His bounty. The Oakland friends brought their children to be blessed by `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá. His talk to the gathering was on the power of the Word of God, the influence of the Supreme Cause and the union of the people of the East and the West. The audience became increasingly humble as the people listened to the Master.”</p><p>Ella Cooper has preserved these words of welcome delivered to the friends at 3:00 P.M., interpreted by Ameen Fareed.</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p><em>I am going to say &quot;Welcome!&quot; to you, instead of your saying &quot;Welcome!&quot; to me. I am most happy to be here with you. I am exceedingly joyous, and I offer thanks to His Holiness Bahaullah that the potency of his word has been instrumental in bringing about such a meeting.</em></p><p><em>There are many people in the world who travel from one country to another. Perchance some may go from here to the Orient, others may come from the Orient here; but these journeys are undertaken in the interests of commerce, politics, or science, or for the sake of travel, or simply to meet friends. All such meetings are accidental (non-essential) because they are concerned only with the exigencies of the world of nature. But I have come from the Orient to the Occident -- that vast distance have I journeyed -- with no commercial purpose in view, nor travel as an object, nor politics as a reason. It has been simply to meet the friends of God. Though the meeting of others is generally accidental, our meeting is real, essential, because the hearts are connected, the souls are attracted, and the spirits are exhilarated. Our meeting is spiritually significant, and great will be the results therefrom; they will be everlasting.</em></p><p><em>Consider bygone times: there occurred a meeting like this one; that is to say, it emanated from the attractions of the conscience; it was due to the spiritual bond; it was due to the heavenly fraternity. Consider the results which later became evident, superstitions that animate them along the lines of prejudice, hatred and rancor, and these various traditional superstitions, having no foundation in reality, are the cause of warfare. The fundamental basis of all the divine religions is reality, and the revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, because it is reality, will be the cause of creating love among the hearts of men and uniting all humanity.</em></p><p><em>The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are concerned also with good conduct, good conduct being the greatest effulgence of the All Glorious. The ethics of the world of humanity must be improved that morality may keep pace with material advancement. Real advancement is dependent upon the world of humanity becoming a center of divine morals, a mirror that will reflect the bestowals of God and the effulgences of the Merciful. Thus will mankind show forth the image and likeness of God. Until divine virtues become revealed in the world of humanity real progress and advancement will not be possible.</em></p><p><em>His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh addressed all mankind, saying, &quot;You are the fruits of one tree and the leaves of one branch,&quot; which signifies that the world of humanity is symbolized by a tree, mankind being likened to its leaves, blossoms and fruits. Hence, all the inhabitants of the earth have grown through their attachment to this blessed tree, and all have been nurtured and reared through the shower of divine mercy. It is self-evident that this teaching is the very spirit of the age. It is life-giving, because through love it animates the people, casts hatred utterly aside, and brings all into friendship and unity.</em></p><p><em>Among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the one requiring man under all conditions and circumstances to be forgiving, to love his enemy and to consider an ill-wisher as a well-wisher; he should not consider another as an enemy and merely put up with him or simply endure him; nor should he consider another as inimical and yet be forbearing toward him. That is hypocrisy. On the contrary, man must regard an enemy as a friend, an ill-wisher as a well-wisher, and treat him accordingly. That is, his kindness must be real; his well-wishing must be real; his love must be real, not merely forbearance, because forbearance is hypocrisy. The people of reality will not accept it.</em></p><p><em>Among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is one on the station of sacrifice. Man must strive at the station of sacrifice, which means complete severance from the things of the world. His possessions, his comforts, even his life, must he sacrifice for humanity. Until man arrives at such a station he deprives himself of the effulgences of God, the bestowals of the Merciful, and the breaths of the Holy Spirit, which in this radiant century have become apparent and resplendent.</em></p><p><em>Among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is one to the effect that God has created man to yield some fruit from his existence -- an eternal fruit, an everlasting result. The life of this world is short; the blessings, virtues and happiness of the world of nature are temporary, hence relatively useless. Therefore when man devotes his energies to the accomplishment of results in the material life only it cannot be called fruitage. Man must be a blessed tree bearing eternal fruits in order that everlasting spirituality may be his. The real fruit of the human tree is eternal. It is the love of God, the knowledge of God, service to the world of humanity, kindness toward all mankind, and endeavoring and striving for the material and spiritual, or ideal, development of the world of man. This is the everlasting fruit. This is the divine effulgence. This is the divine bestowal. This is the everlasting life.</em></p><p><em>The teachings are lengthy, but I have stated them briefly, and from my brief statements of the fundamentals you must learn the full teachings.</em></p><p><em>Praise be to God, we are assembled here through the love of God. Praise be to God, the hearts are kind toward one another, and heavenly radiance is resplendent.</em></p><p><em>I am hopeful that hearts will be moved, that souls will be attracted, and that all will act in accordance with the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.</em></p><p><em>This is a blessed day because the love of Bahá’u’lláh has gathered us together. It is a blessed day because it attracts the bounties of God. It is a blessed day because it is illumined by the heavenly light. It is a blessed day because the breaths of the Holy Spirit are being wafted from the Kingdom of Abhá. It is very blessed. Its results will be most wonderful. Its praises will be never-ending. You will see later on!</em></p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="dGVlbmFnZS">Teenage memory of first meeting &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá </h2><p>Juanita Storch shared her precious 17 year-old youthful memories of her first meeting &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá.</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>When ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came to the Bay Region, in October 1912, the first time I saw him was Thursday afternoon, October 3, 1912, at Mrs. Goodall’s home on Jackson Street, Oakland….</p><p>The rooms were filled and I had to sit on the floor with a few other young folks. From there I could see out of the drawing room, across the hall, to the stairway where ‘Abdu’l-Bahá came down. First we heard his voice, then he came down with four Persians and Mrs. Getsinger, the light from the colored glass window on his head and shoulders.</p><p>When he appeared in the doorway, we all arose and He said “Allah’u’Abha” several times. We answered and He walked to his seat, with a motion of His hand he bade us be seated. Somehow it all seemed so natural and as if we had always seen Him.</p><p>My father had enrolled me at the California School of Arts and Crafts in Berkeley and I was hoping to study the arts and crafts to help him in the future, as he was a talented designer who had studied architecture, but it was not to be. My studies did make me observe people and I could not help but notice all the details of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s build and the beautiful way he used his hands. He never pointed at us. He used his hands more like a cup, offering us his bounty. At the end of his talk he arose and quickly walked through the pressing group of friends, taking some hands as he went. He took my hand as he was passing and he looked into my eyes. It was only a second but it seemed ten minutes.  He still had my hand as he passed, and soon he was through the crowding, his voice vibrating through the room as he spoke phrases. He kissed the babies and went out.</p><p>Many of the friends were exhilarated and all were talking to each other so to escape the confusion I went into the hall where it was quiet and peeked into the dining room as a few voices were coming from there. What a picture I saw! There was ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sitting in a big easy chair by the window. Little children were sitting on his lap and at his feet. He spoke to the children in English.</p><p>Mrs. Cooper told me once that her mother begged her father not to have the vines trimmed that hung over the outside of the window. So now it made a beautiful diffused light as a backdrop for this scene.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="bW90aGVyIG">Mother and nine-year-old daughter met with &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá  </h2><p>Hazel Tomlinson recalled her first meeting with &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá with her nine-year-old daughter in an account she later wrote for Ella Goodall Cooper:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>Mrs. Cooper phoned me to hurry and come to their home, that &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was there.  Did I hurry?  I flew.  On my way I gathered up five dozen of my dolls which I had taught Miss Craft, (a cripple) to make.</p><p>These I sold in Oakland and with some of the money purchased a very large bouquet of violets for &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá.</p><p>My small daughter, Dorothy, nine years of age was with me.  It is hard to describe my first sight of Him.  I only know I melted, dissolved in tears.  The Beloved placed His hands on my shoulders, ejaculated something in Persian and buried His face in the flowers.  He kissed Dorothy on the forehead and told us to <em>Be happy.</em>  </p><p>Wherever He went in this home at that time I followed, and sat at His feet, so happy I cannot describe it.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="YW5vdGhlci">Another description of the blessed afternoon gathering</h2><p>Frances Orr Allen describes the first gathering in Oakland:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>The afternoon of the day of His arrival He crossed the Bay to Oakland where he met the friends at the home of Mrs. Helen S. Goodall.  For 12 years this home had been a meeting place, but on the afternoon of October 3 it became a memorable place – blessed by the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.  After a beautiful address he took the children in His arms, kissed them and blessed them; they felt His love, even following Him into the adjoining room, and one dear baby of four wanted to know if she ‘might pet the God-man’.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="J2FiZHUnbC">&#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá ‘s welcome address to California </h2><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>He gave an address of ‘welcome’ to California at the Goodall home in Oakland.After He had made some brief but beautiful statements about the Bahá’í teachings, He urged those who were present to study them thoroughly.</p></blockquote><p>This address was later published in the <em>Star of the West</em>.</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p><strong>&#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá’s &quot;Welcome&quot; To California.</strong></p><p>Address delivered at the home of Mrs. Helen S. Goodall, Oakland, California, October 3,1912.</p><p>Dr. Ameen U. Fareed, interpreter; stenographic notes by Miss Bijou Straun.</p><p>I am going to say, &quot;Welcome,&quot; to you, instead of your welcoming me. I am most happy to be here with you. I am exceedingly joyous, and I offered thanks to His Holiness BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH that the potency of His Word was instrumental in bringing about such a meeting.</p><p>In the world many people go from one country to another. Perchance they may go from here to the Orient; perchance some may come from the Orient here; but such journeys are for travel, or commercial purposes, or for some political reason, or the motive may be some scientific achievement, or they go on journeys in order to meet friends. All such meetings are accidental; they are concerned with the exigencies of the world of nature.</p><p>But I have come from the Orient to the Occident—this vast distance have I crossed with no commercial purpose in view, nor travel as an object, nor politics as a reason. It has been simply to meet you. Whereas the meeting of others is generally accidental, our meeting is real, essential—for the hearts are connected and the souls are attracted and the spirits are exhilarated, and such a meeting is real in character, and great are the results therefrom. The results are everlasting.</p><p>Consider the by-gone times. There occurred a meeting like this one—that is to say, that meeting emanated from the attractions of the conscience. It was due to the spiritual bond. It was due to the fraternity of heaven. Regard the results which have later become concomitant! What lights have shone therefrom! What a new spirit has been breathed thereby!</p><p>Therefore, I beg of God that this meeting of ours may likewise be a spiritual meeting, may be a heavenly meeting, may be a cordial bond, may be of divine susceptibilities, may be a result of the breaths of the Holy Spirit. Thus, may its traces be everlasting, may its results be eternal, may it be an indissoluble bond and an association inseparable. May it be a love which shall be never ending. This is my hope, and you who have turned to the Kingdom of God, and you who are set aglow with the fire of the Love of God, must so earnestly endeavor that this meeting shall give forth eternal results.</p><p>And what will bring this about?</p><p>This will be brought about by your acting in accordance with the teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH. This is dependent upon your becoming resuscitated by the Divine Spirit. The Revelation of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH is, in relation to the body of the world, as the spirit of man is to his body. In relation to the body of the world (humanity). Divinity is as the light within a lantern. In relation to the soil of the hearts, it is the quickening shower. In relation to the spiritual growth of the trees, it is the vernal breeze; and in relation to the recovery of the diseased body politic, it is a quick acting remedy, because it is the cause of the oneness of the world of humanity. It is love among all mankind. It is a bond which unites all the religions. It is the unity which welds together all the races. It is the connection between all the countries. It is universal peace among the nations. It is universal peace among all the peoples. It is the universal peace which will bring together all nativities. And undoubtedly it is the spirit of the world. It is the light of the world. Likewise, it is an impetus to the promulgation of knowledge, and it is the cause of agreement of religion with science and reason.</p><p>All the nations of the world today are subject to certain superstitions which animate them along the line of prejudice, hatred and rancor. These superstitions are the cause of warfare and battle. For blind imitations of religion are ever various and unreal; but the teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH are reality itself, and reality is the fundamental basis of all the divine religions. Hence these teachings are the very cause of uniting all humanity. They are the cause of love among the hearts of men, for they are reality.</p><p>The teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH are likewise concerned with good conduct, and good conduct is the greatest effulgence of the All-Glorious.</p><p>Unless ethics be improved, the world of humanity will be incapable of true advancement. Real advancement is dependent upon the world of humanity becoming a center of divine morals, becoming a place of the effulgences of the Merciful, becoming a mirror reflecting the bestowals of God. Thereby the world of humanity will become the image and likeness of God. Until these virtues reveal themselves in the world of humanity, real progress and advancement will not be possible.</p><p>His Holiness BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH, addressing all mankind, says: &quot;Ye are all the leaves of one tree and the fruits of one branch.&quot; This signifies that the world of humanity is representative of one tree, and all mankind representative of its leaves, its blossoms and its fruits. Therefore, all the inhabitants of the earth have grown through their attachment to this tree and all are reared and nurtured through the shower of divine mercy. It is self-evident that this teaching is the very spirit of this age. It is life-giving, because through love it animates the people, and it casts alienation utterly aside. It brings all into friendship and unity.</p><p>Among the teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH is one requiring man, under all conditions and circumstances, to be forgiving, to love his enemy and to consider an ill-wisher as a well-wisher. Not that he should consider one as being an enemy and then put up with him, or to simply endure him, or to consider one as inimical and be forbearing toward him. This is declared to be hypocrisy. This love is not real. Nay, rather, you must see your enemies as friends, ill-wishers as well-wishers and treat them accordingly. That is to say, your love and kindness must be real. Your well-wishing must be reality, not merely forbearance, for forbearance, if not of the heart, is hypocrisy. The people of Reality* will not accept it.</p><p>Among the teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH is one on sacrifice. Man must arrive at the point of sacrifice; and the station of sacrifice is that of complete severance—that is, his possessions, his comforts, even his life must be sacrificed for humanity. Until man arrives at such a station, he is deprived of the effulgences of God and from the bestowals of the Merciful, and from the breaths of the Holy Spirit, which, in this radiant century, have become apparent and resplendent.</p><p>And among the teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH is one relative to the fact that God has created man to yield some fruit from his being, or existence, an eternal fruit, an everlasting result. If the world of humanity be confined to the short space of material life here, if man should devote his energies to temporary results—for the life of this world is short, the blessings of this world are temporary, the virtues of the world of nature are temporary, the happiness of the world of nature is temporary—this cannot be called fruitage, because it is temporary and hence useless. Nay, rather, man must be a blessed tree bearing eternal fruits. Thus everlasting spirituality may be his.</p><p>The real fruit of the human tree is everlasting, and that is the love for God, that is the knowledge of God, that is service to the world of humanity, that is kindness to all mankind, and that is endeavoring and striving for the material and spiritual—or ideal—development of the world of man. This is the everlasting fruit. This is the divine effulgence. This is the divine bestowal. This is the everlasting life.</p><p>The teachings are lengthy, but I state them briefly, and from these brief statements, which are fundamental, you must learn the full teachings.</p><p>Praise be to God! We have assembled here, and the cause of our gathering here is the love of God. Praise be to God! The hearts are kind toward each other and the heavenly radiance is resplendent.</p><p>I am hopeful that the hearts may be moved, the souls may be attracted, and that all will act in accordance with the teachings of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH.”</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="J2FiZHUnbC">&#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá spoke to the children after His welcome address to the adults</h2><p>&#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá spoke to the children in the dining room of Mrs. Goodall’s home after His Welcome address to the adultswith these Words as translated by Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>It is a blessed day, because the love of Bahá’u&#x27;lláhhas gathered us together.  It is a blessed day, because it attracts the bounties of God.  It is a blessed day, because it is illumined with the heavenly light.  It is a blessed day, because from the Kingdom of Abhá the breaths of the Holy Spirit are wafted.  It is very blessed.  Its results are most wonderful.  Its praises are never ending.  You will see later on.</p></blockquote><h2 class="" id="ZHVyaW5nIH">During the evening, He crossed the bay back to San Francisco</h2><p>Mírzá Mahmúd-i-Zarqání describes the sight He saw and how He enjoyed it:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>There is a bay between San Francisco and Oakland which can be crossed in 15 minutes by boat.

This interview was published next day in a form almost unrecognizable.</p><p>From the Diary of Mírzá Ahmad Sohráb</p><p>CORRESPONDENT: Are you pleased with the United States?</p><p>&#x27;ABDU’L-BAHÁ: <em>The continent of America is most progressive. The means of instructions are prepared; the educational institutions are thoroughly equipped and the pupils are being systematically trained and educated. The wealth is on an upward tendency. Its government is democratic. Its advancement is unceasing. Its nation is hospitable. Its people are loyal, energetic and noble. Its inhabitants are free and the lovers of liberty. Its men are civilized and its women are cultured, refined and idealistic. On the other hand, all these advantages are on the material plane, and I observe the majority of the people are submerged in the sea of materialism and agnosticism. The natural civilization is well-nigh perfect; but it is in need of the civilization of heaven—Divine civilization.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: What do you mean by &quot;Divine civilization&quot;?</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>Divine civilization is the light. Material civilization is the lamp. Material civilization is the body; in itself it is not sufficient, and humanity from every standpoint stands in sore need of divine civilization. Natural civilization insures material welfare and prosperity; Divine civilization vouchsafes to man ideal virtues. Material civilization serves the physical world; divine civilization serves the world of morality. Divine civilization is a symposium of the perfections of the world of humanity. Divine civilization is the improvement of the ethical life of a nation. Divine civilization is the discovery of the reality of phenomena. Divine civilization is the spiritual philosophy. Divine civilization is the knowledge of God with rational and intellectual evidences. Divine civilization is Eternal Life. Divine civilization is the immortality of the soul. Divine civilization is the Breath of the Holy Spirit. Divine civilization is heavenly wisdom. Divine civilization is the reality of all the Teachings of the ancient prophets. Divine civilization is Universal Peace and the oneness of the world of humanity. The Holy manifestations of God have been the founders of Divine civilization, the first Teachers of mankind, and the spreaders of the fragrances of holiness and sanctity amongst the children of men.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: Are you satisfied with the American people?</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>The American people are a stranger-loving people. All nations are welcomed in their midst. They give to everyone the right of living and the pursuit of happiness. Here no one feels a foreigner, I am satisfied with all of them.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: I have heard that you advocate the complete equality of men and women. This radical teaching coming from an Oriental thinker is of great interest and supreme significance. Just at this juncture the California women are clamoring for the right to vote for all the national and state officials, and your opinion on this important question will be greatly appreciated by the people.</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>The question of equality between men and women has made greater advancement in America than elsewhere, and day by day it is assuming greater importance and becoming nearer to realization. However, as long as complete equality does not exist between male and female, the world of humanity will not make extraordinary progress. The woman is an important column, and there is another equally important. If we aim to have a durable building, the foundations of both columns must be laid very deep. The women are the first teachers and instructors of the small children. They teach them and inculcate morality in their minds and hearts. Later they go to universities for higher education and specialization. Now if the teacher or instructor is deficient, how can the scholar be properly trained? Therefore, it is proven that the culture and refinement of the men are intensified and will bloom and attain to perfect fruition when the women are equally educated and given the same educational facilities. Consequently the women must enjoy all the learning they are able to assimilate, in order that they may reach to the same level as men. The same privileges and opportunities must be conferred upon women; —so that just as they share together life and its responsibilities, they may also share with him the same virtues of the world of humanity. Undoubtedly partnership in education and culture presupposes equality in rights. The world of humanity has two wings, one wing male, the other wing female.</em></p><p><em>Both wings must become strong, so that mankind may soar to the empyrean realms of its destined perfection. But if one wing is left weak and the other strong, its upward flight will be slow. God hath created both human. They share together and in common all the faculties. No one is endowed with special privileges. How can we make a distinction which is unknown in the sight of God? We must follow the policy of God.</em></p><p><em>Moreover, there is male and female in the vegetable kingdom. They are on an equal footing. Inherently they enjoy suffrage and there is no distinction between them. Likewise in the animal kingdom the right of suffrage and equality is enjoyed without any feeling of superiority of privilege. Therefore, it is well known that there is no distinction of gender in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, although they are deprived of the faculty of reasoning, and they have not the power of distinguishing. How can we, who are confirmed with the bestowal of reason, and enjoy all the facilities with which man is distinguished from the animal, act in this manner and build these false barriers? Many women have appeared who have won for themselves fame and name, for the versatility of their intellects and the brilliancy of their thoughts. Amongst the Bahai women many have shown remarkable capability in literature, sciences and arts, and have rendered distinguished service in every department of life.</em></p><p><em>In history many capable women appear who have displayed special genius in government and political administration, such as Semiramis; Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, and Queen Victoria, of England. In the religious world, —the Israelites wandered for forty years in the wilderness and could not conquer the Holy Land. Finally a woman achieved the signal victory. During the Christian dispensation the apostles became agitated after the Crucifixion of Jesus; even Peter denied Him thrice, but Mary Magdalene became the cause of their becoming firm and</em> <em>steadfast. In the Religion of BAHA&#x27;O&#x27;LLAH, Kurat-el-Ayn and many other Persian women demonstrated their knowledge and wisdom to such an extent that even the men were astonished, and listened to their advices and lectures.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: What is your object in coming to America?</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>I have come to America to promote the ideal of Universal Peace and the solidarity of the human race. I have not come for pleasure or as a tourist.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: What do you think about women&#x27;s fashions?</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>We do not look upon the dresses of women, whether or not they are of the latest mode. We are not the judge of fashions. We rather judge the wearer of dresses. If she be chaste, if she be cultured, if she be characterized with heavenly morality, and if she be favored at the Threshold of God, she is honored and respected by us, no matter what manner of dress she wears. We have nothing to do with the ever-changing world of modes.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: What is the greatest thing you have seen in America?</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>The greatest thing I have seen in America is its freedom. In reality this is a free nation and a democratic government.</em></p><p>CORRESPONDENT: What is your opinion about Turkey and the Balkan War?</p><p>ABDUL-BAHA: <em>We have nothing to do with war. We are advocates of peace. Speak to us about the condition of peace. Go to diplomatists and militarists and ask their opinion about this war. But as regards peace: In the world of humanity there is no more important affair, no weightier cause. It is conducive to the well-being of the world of creation; the means of the prosperity of the nations; the reason of eternal friendship between the people; the cause of solidarity between the East and the West; the promoter of real freedom, and the Most Eminent Favor of His Highness the Almighty. We must all strive to upraise the flag of international peace, the oneness of the world of humanity and the spiritual brotherhood of mankind.</em></p></blockquote><p>[The correspondent tried to ask a few more questions, but &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá interrupted him by this final statement while putting his hand on his shoulder and kissing his face]</p><p><em>Consider how much I love thee, and to what extent I respect Mr. Hearst, that notwithstanding the fatigue coming over me as the result of a very busy day, I have answered all thy questions</em>.</p><p>The article published the next day under the headline “Abdu&#x27;l-Baba [sic] Suffrage Advocate – Sex Equality Need for Progress - Famous Leader Asserts Americans Are Lovable, but Submerged in Dollar Hunting” described the setting of the interview and those translating, and  some responses given by &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá.</p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/blessedfootsteps/337322c7-84e4-447a-a528-b7f255736495_A-B+SF-P17444-001+residence+looking+downhill.jpg?auto=compress,format" width="2448" height="1833" class="app-image px-0 app-image-portrait"/><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>Surrounded by his Persian secretaries, &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá Abbás, one of the great leaders of the modern times and spiritual adviser to fifty million followers, sat in an armchair at 1815 California street last night, discussing American manners and ideals, suffrage and women&#x27;s fashions, and told of the most wonderful things he had found in America.</p><p>The aged philosopher and head of the Bahá’í movement, which teaches the fundamental unity of all creeds, and the blessedness of universal peace, arrived in San Francisco on the Overland Limited late Wednesday night for a stay of three weeks.

Birds excel all in sensual pleasures, for they build nests on the loftiest branches and breathe the purest air. All seeds and fruit are their property. Limpid streams, charming plains, beautiful fields, verdant hills, green valleys, exquisite gardens and lovely flowers are all for their pleasure and happiness. They have no grief, regrets, aspirations, ambitions, quarrels, contentions, wars or massacres. If the purpose of existence is sensual life and pleasures, then animal and man are equal. Happiness and pleasure are rather the possession of the bird and not those of distressed and sorrowful men.
