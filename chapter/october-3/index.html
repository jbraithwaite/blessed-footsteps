It was shortly before two o’clock in the morning, the train having been several hours late. Dr. Frederick W. D&#x27; Evelyn, chairman of the San Francisco Bahá’í Assembly, had waited at the Ferry Building to meet and escort them to the residence at 1815 California Street which had been secured by Mrs. Helen S. Goodall for their San Francisco sojourn.</p></blockquote><p>Dr.  D’Evelyn has left this account of the arrival of &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá to San Francisco:</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>SAN FRANCISCO, October 3, 1912.</p><p>The trans-continental passengers to San Francisco leave their train at Oakland, and are ferried across the Bay to their journey&#x27;s end. Arriving there, they disembark and follow the wharf to a long corridor, terminating on the &quot;Main Street,&quot; here their friends are permitted to meet them.</p><p>It was October 2nd, 1912, a day of great expectancy in San Francisco. The furnished home prepared for &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was garnished, swept and beflowered.  All arrangements were complete. Slowly the hours seemed to pass. Eventide came, and with it, disconcerting reports of delay. Telegrams confirmed that the reports, while telegrams to railway headquarters brought the discomforting news that schedule time had been abandoned, and no time of arrival was hazarded. Close on mid-night a telegram from &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá instructed friends not to await His arrival, ‘send only one friend to depot.’ Without in leastwise anticipating such orders, we were instructed to comply with &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá’s request.</p><p>Securing two taxis we left for the Ferry. Arriving there we ascertained the sections may possibly arrive about 1.30 a.m. The night deepened, the Ferry was deserted. The lights of the city waned to a minimum. The ever dimly lighted corridor became still darker and still more gloomy and lonely. But we were awaiting the Master.  At 1.40 a.m. the siren announced the incoming of a belated ferry-boat. Some minutes later the slide at the end of the corridor was upraised. A few, very few emerged. They reached the street, still no evidence of the Master. What, if he was not there? The half-lowered slide seemed a sort of possibly confirmatory evidence. By this time, a night patrol man, we of the taxi party and a red-capped porter constituted the entire population of the corridor. The red-cap we assumed had come over the Bay, so addressing him we enquired had all the passengers of both sections come over? His reply was negative. Still hoping, we ventured to enquire - were there any unusual looking people on board? Yes, he replied, there is a very old gentleman with strange dress and several other strangers with Him. This was reassuring. Once again we hoped and centered our gaze upon the far end of the corridor. Some minutes later &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá appeared, walking slowly, calmly, majestically, followed by his secretaries. Forgetful of boundary lines, uncovering, we advanced to meet him. He drew near more rapidly and with outstretched arms he embraced us, uttering a salutation followed by the English words-&quot;Very good; very good.&quot;  &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá was in San Francisco.</p><p>Leading the way to the side-walk where the taxis awaited us, one was naturally desirous after seating &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, to attend to the welfare of his staff. But it was not to be, for saying something to his staff, he, through an interpreter, desired that we should seat ourselves beside him. The strange, great, new thing awed one into silence. But &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, with a perceptible note of pleasure, a victorious gladsomeness in his voice as if a long-hoped for moment had been attained - said, &quot;Speak to me.&quot; But how could one speak, what would one say-was it not the birthing of a moment-from which henceforth even time must find its dating, and eternity its reckoning?</p><p>Ere long we reached the home, made ready by true, loving and expectant friends.  Rare indeed was the reverential welcome extended to &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá. Orient and Occident had met. Supper was served, prepared by Persian friends then resident in San Francisco.  Truly a never to be forgotten communion.  The guest, the words of wisdom, the mentionings of the past, the herald-dawn of a wondrous present.</p><p>That night we slept under the master’s roof, our room-mate being Fugeta of Japan, now of Haifa. Time has even now confirmed its memory as a reality, while history registers it an epoch significant and momentous. &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá reached San Francisco, the west-the sun had set, the lamps were lightless, the people slumbered and slept. The Center of the Covenant, Bearer of the Message, came and uttered the call of the Kingdom of God. ‘Be confident, have no doubt about it, this banner of Bahá’u’lláh will be unfurled waving towards all religions. The anthem of the Oneness of the world of humanity will confer a new life upon all the children of men.’</p><p>Thirteen years later, the memory echoes this benediction as a greeting to the loved ones far away in the Isles of the Southern Seas.

Dr. [Frederick] D&#x27;Evelyn, a devoted Bahá&#x27;í, came running as soon as he saw the Master and prostrated himself at His feet. On the way to the city Dr. D&#x27;Evelyn described for about 15 minutes the yearning of the friends and how they longed to see the Center of the Covenant. When we reached the house especially prepared for `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá the waiting friends came out to welcome Him.  Mr. and Mrs. Ralston, Mrs. Goodall, Mrs. Cooper and the other friends were ecstatically happy to have the honor and bounty of being in His presence and to have supper with Him.”</p><p></p><h3 class="" id="b3ZlcnZpZX">Overview of San Francisco daily routine</h3><p>Ella Cooper summarized ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s typical days in San Francisco</p><blockquote class="font-serif"><p>&#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was immediately in demand.

Notwithstanding his time was so fully occupied, he made a point of motoring nearly every day in Golden Gate Park, where he could enjoy the trees and flowers and walk around the numerous lakes watching the birds. He also walked frequently in the neighborhood parks (plazas), sometimes with his secretaries, but often alone.

Welcome, very welcome!  I am greatly rejoiced at meeting you all.  Praise be to God you came now.</p><p>Meetings are various in kind.  One meeting is like the meeting of people, an ordinary meeting, which is so easily forgotten.  Howsoever kind they may be to each other they will forget it.  For example, a brother meeting another brother, the father meeting his son, sisters meeting, the mother meeting a daughter, or the daughter the mother, when separation takes place in the course of time gradually that relation will be forgotten.  Such a meeting is without result; eventually it sinks into forgetfulness.</p><p>Another meeting is similar to the meeting of the sun with the mirror.  The rays of the sun shine upon the mirror.  Again, there may be a meeting like the coming together of combustible wood with fire, or the mingling of oil with fire.  As soon as contact is effected, combustion takes place.  Ah, such a meeting is good!</p><p>Again, there is a meeting which is like unto the contact of the gentle zephyrs with the tree, which exhilarates the trees, which bestows freshness and verdure;

Telegrams confirmed that the reports, while telegrams to railway headquarters brought the discomforting news that schedule time had been abandoned, and no time of arrival was hazarded.

Some minutes later the slide at the end of the corridor was upraised. A few, very few emerged. They reached the street, still no evidence of the Master. What, if he was not there? The half-lowered slide seemed a sort of possibly confirmatory evidence. By this time, a night patrol man, we of the taxi party and a red-capped porter constituted the entire population of the corridor. The red-cap we assumed had come over the Bay, so addressing him we enquired had all the passengers of both sections come over? His reply was negative. Still hoping, we ventured to enquire - were there any unusual looking people on board? Yes, he replied, there is a very old gentleman with strange dress and several other strangers with Him. This was reassuring. Once again we hoped and centered our gaze upon the far end of the corridor. Some minutes later 'Abdu'l-Bahá appeared, walking slowly, calmly, majestically, followed by his secretaries. Forgetful of boundary lines, uncovering, we advanced to meet him.

But 'Abdu'l-Bahá, with a perceptible note of pleasure, a victorious gladsomeness in his voice as if a long-hoped for moment had been attained - said, \"Speak to me.\" But how could one speak, what would one say-was it not the birthing of a moment-from which henceforth even time must find its dating, and eternity its reckoning?","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ere long we reached the home, made ready by true, loving and expectant friends.  Rare indeed was the reverential welcome extended to 'Abdu'l-Bahá.
