Dr. Frederick W.

Fugeta, a young Japanese who had received the Message while working as &quot;school-boy&quot; in the home of Mrs. Kathryn Frankland in Fruitvale, California.  Afterward at &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá’s command he had gone to Chicago to study. He was living with the family of Mrs. Corinne True. &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá as he passed through Chicago, attached Fugeta to his retinue. &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá and His party were the guests of Mrs. Goodall at 1815 California Street in San Francisco and at her Oakland home whenever He had engagements across the bay.</p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">Ramona Brown recalled the wonderful day of His coming </p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">“Finally this wonderful day of His coming arrived.  He was met at the train by Dr. D’Evelyn and escorted to the home on California Street.  &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá had requested by telegraph that no gathering of the friends should meet Him at the station, as His train was not due until late at night, and that He would meet them in the morning.  Early the following morning a group of friends attended &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá, and He gave an impromptu talk on his arrival in San Francisco.”</p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">Dr. D’Evelyn left his account of welcoming &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá to San Francisco</p><blockquote class="sm:-mx-24 font-serif text-lg leading-loose border-l-8 pl-5 sm:pl-10 py-5 my-5"><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">SAN FRANCISCO, October 3, 1912</p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">“The trans-continental passengers to San Francisco leave their train at Oakland, and are ferried across the Bay to their journey&#x27;s end.

The furnished home prepared for &#x27;Abdu’l-Bahá was garnished, swept and beflowered.  All arrangements were complete. Slowly the hours seemed to pass. Eventide came, and with it, disconcerting reports of delay. Telegrams confirmed that the reports, while telegrams to railway headquarters brought the discomforting news that schedule time had been abandoned, and no time of arrival was hazarded. Close on mid-night a telegram from &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá instructed friends not to await His arrival, ‘send only one friend to depot.’ Without in leastwise anticipating such orders, we were instructed to comply with &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá’s request.</p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">“Securing two taxis we left for the Ferry. Arriving there we ascertained the sections may possibly arrive about 1.30 a.m. The night deepened, the Ferry was deserted. The lights of the city waned to a minimum. The ever dimly lighted corridor became still darker and still more gloomy and lonely. But we were awaiting the Master.  At 1.40 a.m. the siren announced the incoming of a belated ferry-boat. Some minutes later the slide at the end of the corridor was upraised. A few, very few emerged. They reached the street, still no evidence of the Master. What, if he was not there? The half lowered slide seemed a sort of possibly confirmatory evidence. By this time, a night patrol man, we of the taxi party and a red-capped porter constituted the entire population of the corridor. The red-cap we assumed had come over the Bay, so addressing him we enquired had all the passengers of both sections come over? His reply was negative. Still hoping, we ventured to enquire - were there any unusual looking people on board? Yes, he replied, there is a very old gentleman with strange dress and several other strangers with Him. This was reassuring. Once again we hoped and centered our gaze upon the far end of the corridor. Some minutes later &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá appeared, walking slowly, calmly, majestically, followed by his secretaries. Forgetful of boundary lines, uncovering, we advanced to meet him. He drew near more rapidly and with outstretched arms he embraced us, uttering a salutation followed by the English words &quot;Very good; very good.&quot;  &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá was in San Francisco.</p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">“Leading the way to the sidewalk where the taxis awaited us, one was naturally desirous after seating &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, to attend to the welfare of his staff. But it was not to be, for saying something to his staff, he, through an interpreter, desired that we should seat ourselves beside him. The strange, great, new thing awed one into silence. But &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, with a perceptible note of pleasure, a victorious gladsomeness in his voice as if a long-hoped for moment had been attained - said, &quot;Speak to me.&quot; But how could one speak, what would one say-was it not the birthing of a moment-from which henceforth even time must find its dating, and eternity its reckoning?</p><p class="mb-5 oldstyle-nums">“Ere long we reached the home, made ready by true, loving and expectant friends.  Rare indeed was the reverential welcome extended to &#x27;Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá.
